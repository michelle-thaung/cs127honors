## Manhattan Neighborhood Rankings
Most of the rankings system rate the individual aspects of each neighborhood, such as nightlife, schooling system, affordability, housing, convenience, safety, and family-friendliness. Some of the ranking systems, such as Niche and Street Advisor, use reviews given by residents in those neighborhoods to aid in the ranking through a five star range. When rating different aspects of the neighborhood, most review systems will cite the experiences of long term residents as evidence. Some sites, such as Curbedâ€™s Walkable Neighborhoods, only focus on one quality when ranking an entire neighborhood (in this instance it is the walkability of an area, which includes bike paths, sidewalk layout, etc.). 

We focused on three qualities: 
1. Accessibility - During COVID, access to open usable roadways and large walkways are essential in ensuring the ability to have a comfortable dining experience that also does not disturb other pedestrians.
2. Cleanliness - Sanitation is important as many restaurants because of COVID-19 have undergone extreme cleaning procedures and temperature checks are common as well.
3. Affordability - This is an important factor in ranking as exorbitantly high and unjustified prices does not allow many people to have access to different types of restaurants and dining experiences.

After compiling data, we assembled the following list of rankings of our selected Manhattan neighborhoods (from best to worst):
1. East Village
2. Chelsea
3. SoHo
4. West Village
5. Midtown
